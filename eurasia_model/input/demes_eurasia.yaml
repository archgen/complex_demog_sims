description:
  'This model aims to be somewhat reflective of the complexity underlying the demographic history of 
  the Ancient Near East and Western Mediterranean human populations. Whilst the complexity of this model
  undoubetedly falls short of the true complexity of the human past, it is intended to challenge the performance
  of commonly used statistical tools in reconstructing the genetic history of human populations.
  Whilst the majority of simulation parameters are guided by a synthesis of the archaeogenetic literature a number
  of simplifications had to be taken to keep the number of popualtions and admixture events modest. 


  Population sizes are given in diploid ploidy as msprime simulations are in DTWF model format.
  Time is given in units of generations with a generation time of 29 years.'
